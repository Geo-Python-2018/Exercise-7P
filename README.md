# Exercise 7P: Plotting data in Python

This week we'll put together our data analysis and plotting skills using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the temperature data we have been exploring for the course thus far.

For each problem you need to modify the given notebook, and then upload your files to GitHub.
The answers to the questions in this week's exercise should be given by modifying the document in places where asked.
